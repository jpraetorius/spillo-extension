# Firefox extension for [Spillo](//bananafishsoftware.com/products/spillo/)

This extension sends the current active browser tab to spillo for saving with [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in). The URL and Title of the Page are sent to Spillo, so all you have to do is add your Description and you're good to go ðŸŽ‰.

This extension is inspired by [spillo-firefox-extension](https://github.com/albohlabs/spillo-firefox-extension) and tries to redo its efforts in a way compatible with the current browser extension APIs. My version of this addon is solely distributed through the [Firefox Addons Website](https://addons.mozilla.org).

## Install

Download the Extension from [the Firefox Extension Directory](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/send-to-spillo/)

## Fiddle with it

1.  Clone the _spillo-extension_ repository
2.  Make any changes
3.  Go to `about:debugging` in Firefox and load the Contents of the repo as temporary Extension

## Build it

1.  Install `web-ext` by running `npm i -g web-ext`
2.  Run `web-ext build` in your checkout of the tool to create the .zip necessary for installation and redistribution (see [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Distribution) for how to distribute properly).

- [Ed Mechem](https://github.com/edmechem) also kept Compatibility for FF75+
